*NOTE:* **This is Archived - you're welcome to use the code to do whatever else you need in the future.**

------

Set or inspect the colors that Apple OSX Finder assigns to files or folders.

Usable as a standalone script, or it can be imported as a python module.

=================
Standalone Usage:
=================

To find out the color of a file or folder: ::

    finder_colors.py $filename

returns: ::

    filename    colorname

You can check multiple files at once, with: ::

    finder_colors.py $file1 $file2 $file3

or from the shell, wildcards ::

    finder_colors.py *.txt

To set the color: ::

    finder_colors.py $color $filename

You can assign multiple files at once by: ::

    finder_colors.py $color $filename $filename2 $filename3 $etc

so in a shell: ::

    finder_colors.py red *.py

would set all python scripts to red.

Options for colors are: ::

    none, gray, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, orange

If you're worried that you may have files in the list which could be valid
color names, then simply invoke using path names ( `./filename` rather than
`filename`, or with wildcards `./*` rather than `*`).

This is good practice in general.

===================
As a python module:
===================

After installing (by PIP): ::

    >>> import finder_colors
    >>> finder_colors.get('/path/to/file')
    'none'

    >>> finder_colors.set('/path/to/file', 'red')
    '\x00........'

The value returned by `set(pathname, color)` is the complete
com.apple.FinderInfo attribute list of that file.  You can probably ignore it.

=============
Installation:
=============

Either with pip ::

    pip install finder_colors

Or simply download the finder_colors.py script, and put it somewhere in
your $PATH (usually /usr/local/bin works...) and run ::

    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/finder_colors.py
