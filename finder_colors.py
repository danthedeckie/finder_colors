------------------

Usage:

$finder_colors.py <filename>

outputs which colour it's been set to.

$finder_colors.py <color> <filename>

sets the color.

------------------

You can also include this as a python module, and use the two functions:

set(filename, color)

and

get(filename)

which work pretty much as you'd expect.
